=== DGtal 0.4 ===
Posted on September 26, 2011 by David Coeurjolly

	* Global changes:
	   - A better decomposition of DGtal algorithms and
	data structures into packages.
	   - By default, DGtal is built with minimal dependencies.
	   - Concepts and concept checking mechanism have been
	considerably improved.
	
	* Kernel Package: refactoring of Integer types considered in
	DGtal.

	* Topology Package: Interpixel/cellular topological model,
	boundary tracking tools, ...

	* Geometry Package: 
	  - many things have been added in the 1D contour analysis module:
	multi-modal representation of 1D contours and curves (GridCurve facade),
	decomposition/segmentation into primitives, many differential
	estimators added, helpers for multigrid comparison of estimators
	  - multigrid digital set generators from implicit and parametric
	shapes in dimension 2.
	
	* I/O Package: refactoring/enhancements of DGtal boards and
	viewers, a new Board3Dto2D board has been added (based on libcairo).

	* Tools: multigrid shapeGenerator/contourGenerator added,
	lengthEstimator/estimatorComparator  added for differential
	estimator multigrid comparison,...
	  
	* Documentation: User guide has been improved thanks to a
	decomposition of the library into packages.

=== DGtal 0.3.1 ===
Posted on April 4, 2011 by David Coeurjolly
	
	* Quick release due to a build problem on linux. No more feature
	added.
	* Preliminary cellular grid documentation added.
	* Documentation cleanup.



	
=== DGtal 0.3.0 ===
Posted on April 1, 2011 by David Coeurjolly

Beside the DGtal presentation at DGCI 2011, we are pleased to announce a new DGtal release 0.3.0.

New features:

    User-guide added (based on doxygen system)
    Kernel: new concepts and controls to enhance the Interger type management, new iterators (Range/SubRange) on HyperRectDomains.
    Topology: interpixel model added (cells, boundary tracking mechanisms,…)
    Geometry 2D: 2D curve primitive decomposition, tangential cover, convexity/concavity decomposition.
    Geometry nD: reverse Euclidean distance transformation
    Visualisation: stream mechanism to visualize 3D DGtal objects with libQGLViewer (optional)
    Shape generator factory added in nD

BugFixes, enhancements:

    Many bugs have been fixed for this release.
    cmake DGtal dependency checking process is more stable now

Known problems:

    For technical reasons, we haven’t be able to verify that this release also compile on Windows Visual Studio systems (see ticket #87). A new release will fix this problem as soon as possible.
    All open tickets
