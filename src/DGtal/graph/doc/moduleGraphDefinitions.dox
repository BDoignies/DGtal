   This module defines what are graphs in DGtal, as well as basic
   associated concepts. Relevant digital models of graph are notably
   found in package \ref packageTopology.

   The following programs are related to this documentation: graphTraversal.cpp

   @section dgtal_graph_def_1 Graph concepts in DGtal

   There are many different ways for representing a given graph, even
   without considering types that attached data to vertices and edges,
   the most notable ones are adjacency lists per vertex, incidence
   matrix, outgoing edges per vertex. A rather comprehensive set of \b
   finite graph concepts may for instance be found in the boost::graph
   module.

   Graphs in DGtal may be finite (like Object) or only locally finite
   (like MetricAdjacency). Graphs in DGtal are undirected. Therefore,
   they are two different concepts for graphs:

   - locally finite graphs satisfy concept
     CUndirectedSimpleLocalGraph. There is no way to iterate through
     all vertices of that kind of graph (since they can be
     infinite). Edges of this graph are given through an adjacency
     list for each vertex.

     - Notable models: MetricAdjacency
     - Notable refinements: CAdjacency, CUndirectedSimpleGraph

   - finite graphs satisfy concept CUndirectedSimpleGraph, a
     refinement of CUndirectedSimpleLocalGraph. Such graphs provide
     vertex iterators to enumerate all the vertices of the graph. Such
     iterators may only be single pass input iterators.

     - Notable models: Object, DigitalSurface, LightImplicitDigitalSurface, LightExplicitDigitalSurface

   All graphs define a \c Vertex (which must be instance-able,
   copy-able, assignable) and a \c Size type (type for counting
   vertices). Furthermore, they must provide a default type \c
   VertexSet for representing a set of Vertex, and a defaut type
   rebinder \c VertexMap for representing a map with key Vertex.

   @note DGtal graph concepts are very light compared to boost::graph
   for instance. The advantage is that it is easy to create new models
   of graph in DGtal. The disadvantage is that you may not be able to
   design the best optimized graph algorithms in some case. @see
   dgtal_graph_def_3

   @note For now, DGtal does not provide a generic graph model.


   @section dgtal_graph_def_2 Using graphs

   This section gathers the basic ways of using graphs.

   @subsection dgtal_graph_def_2_1 Instanciating graphs

   The instanciation of graphs (like any object) is dependent on the
   chosen graph model. For instance, to instantiate a MetricAdjacency
   or an Object, you can consult \ref moduleDigitalTopology. To
   instantiate a DigitalSurface, you may consult \ref
   dgtal_digsurf_sec3.

   Here is a simple example for creating a 2D digital object seen with
   the (4,8) adjacency (in example graphTraversal.cpp)

   @snippet graph/graphTraversal.cpp graphTraversal-graph-instanciation

   The last line above checks that Object are finite graphs.

   @subsection dgtal_graph_def_2_2 Enumerating vertices of a graph

   We simply use the range [begin(),end()) offered by graphs. This is done as follows.

   @snippet graph/graphTraversal.cpp graphTraversal-graph-enumeration
