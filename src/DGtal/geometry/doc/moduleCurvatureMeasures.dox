Part of the \ref packageGeometry.

This part of the manual describes the implementation of several
curvature measures on quite arbitrary meshes (any instance of
SurfaceMesh). The classical curvature measures related to the Normal
Cycle are provided as well as the more general curvature measures
based on corrected normal currents.
