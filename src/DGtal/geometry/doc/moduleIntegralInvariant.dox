\section sectOverview Overview


The algorithm implemented in the class DGtal::IntegralInvariantMeanCurvatureEstimator (resp. DGtal::IntegralInvariantGaussianCurvatureEstimator)
are detailed in the article @cite Coeurjo2013 .

In geometry processing, interesting mathematical tools have been developed to design differential estimators on smooth
surfaces based on integral invariants @cite Pottmann2007 @cite Pottmann2009 .
The principle is simple: we move a convolution kernel along the shape surface and we compute integrals on the intersection
between the shape and the convolution kernel, as follow in dimension 3:

@f[ V_r(x) = \int_{B_r(x)}  \chi(p)dp\ @f]

where @f$ B_r(x) @f$ is the Euclidean ball of radius @f$ r @f$, centered at @f$ x @f$ and @f$ \chi(p) @f$ the
characteristic function of @f$ X @f$. In dimension 2, we simply denote @f$ A_r(x) @f$ such quantity (represented in orange
color on the following figure).

\subsection subsectIntegralInvariant Integral Invariants for curvature computation

In [1], we have demonstrated that some digital integral quantities provide curvature information when the kernel size tends
to zero for a sufficiently smooth shape.
Indeed, at @f$ x @f$ of the digitized surface @f$ X @f$ and with a fixed radius @f$ r @f$, we obtain convergent local digital
curvature estimators @f$ \tilde{\kappa}_r(X,x) @f$ and @f$ \tilde{H}_r(X,x) @f$ of quantities @f$ \kappa(X,x) @f$ and
@f$ H(X,x) @f$ respectively:

@f[
  \tilde{\kappa}_r(X,x) = \frac{3\pi}{2r} - \frac{3A_r(x)}{r^3},\quad \tilde{\kappa}_r(X,x) =  \kappa(X,x)+ O(r)
@f]

@f[
  \tilde{H}_r(X,x) = \frac{8}{3r} - \frac{4V_r(x)}{\pi r^4},\quad \tilde{H}_r(X,x) = H(X,x) + O(r)
@f]

where @f$ \kappa_r(X,x) @f$ is the 2d curvature of @f$ X @f$ at @f$ x @f$ and @f$ H_r(X,x) @f$ is the 3d mean curvature
of @f$ X @f$ at @f$ x @f$.

We have demonstrated in [1] that to prove the multigrid convergence with a convergence speed of @f$ O(h^{\frac{1}{3}}) @f$
when the Euclidean radius of the kernel follow the rule @f$ r = k_mh^{\alpha_m} @f$ ( @f$ \alpha_m = \frac{1}{3} @f$
provides better worst-case errors, so we will use this value).

\section sectAlgo Algorithm

\subsection subsectDef Overall algorithm

The user part is rather simple by using only DGtal::IntegralInvariantMeanCurvatureEstimator or DGtal::IntegralInvariantGaussianCurvatureEstimator.
These classes are parametrized by a Khalimsky space of a digital shape and a functor who return a value for a given
Khalimsky cell. Indeed, the @f$ \chi(p) @f$ characteristic function is defined as a functor (here with values in
@f$ \{0,1\} @f$ for each spel of the Khalimsky space).

At initialization (DGtal::IntegralInvariantMeanCurvatureEstimator::init()), we specify the current grid step @f$ h @f$, and an Euclidean radius @f$ r_e @f$ in
order to construct the convolution kernel. As described below, this parameter @f$ r_e @f$ determines
the level of feature detected by the estimator.

For the evaluation (DGtal::IntegralInvariantMeanCurvatureEstimator::eval()), the user has two possibilities: evaluate the curvature at a specific surfel of the
digitized shape surface, or at a range of surfels.
This choice can be important because optimizations are available with the second option (see in Technical details ).
For the first one, the estimator return a curvature value at the given surfel.
If you choose the second possibility, the estimator will try to optimize computations by using previous results. But it requires to set a range of 0-adjacent surfels. If the range of surfels does not follow
that rule, no optimization is performed.

\subsection subsectDetails Technical details

To sum up, we need a convolution kernel which will be integrated along a digitized shape boundary.
At initialization, we first create a convolution kernel (DGtal::Ball2D in 2d, DGtal::Ball3D in 3d) of Euclidean radius
@f$ r_e @f$ and digitized at the grid step @f$ h @f$. DGtal::DigitalSurfaceConvolver is in charge of centering the convolution kernel
on the surfel on the digitized shape border. Its objective is to compute @f$ B_{r/h}(\frac{1}{h} \cdot x ) \cap Z @f$ and @f$ B_{r/h}
(\frac{1}{h} \cdot x ) \cap Z' @f$ from Eq. (\ref{eq:def-curvature-estimator2d}) and (\ref{eq:def-curvature-estimator3d}).

At evaluation, it will place the convolution kernel in order to lie his center with the cell to estimate. After, it will
iterate on all spels of the kernel, and compute the integral:

@f[
        V(x) = \sum_{spel \in B_{r/h}(\frac{1}{h} \cdot x ) \cap Z}f(x)g(s-x)
@f]

where @f$ x @f$ is the current spel, @f$ f @f$ is the shape functor (set by user), @f$ g @f$ is the kernel functor (return 1 on all spels
from the kernel).
DGtal::IntegralInvariantMeanCurvatureEstimator uses this result to get @f$ \widehat{Area}(B_{r/h}(\frac{1}{h} \cdot x ) \cap Z, h) @f$
in 2d and @f$ \widehat{Vol}(B_{r/h}(\frac{1}{h} \cdot x ) \cap Z', h) @f$ in 3d. With Eq. (\ref{eq:def-curvature-estimator2d}) and
(\ref{eq:def-curvature-estimator3d}), it finally returns curvature quantities. Using this approach, we obtain a computation
cost in @f$ O((r/h)^d) @f$ per surface element.

For DGtal:IntegralInvariantGaussianCurvatureEstimator, the initialization is the same but at evaluation
DGtal::DigitalSurfaceConvolver computes a covariance matrix of @f$ B_{r/h}(\frac{1}{h} \cdot x ) \cap Z' @f$. Eigenvectors and
eigenvalues analysis of this covariance matrix helps us to extract principal curvatures information. We can easily obtain
mean or Gaussian curvature from them.

When we move the convolution kernel to 0-adjacent cells, we see that only few cells need to be updated from the previous
convolution.

@image latex MovingKernel.png "Illustration of a displacement of a full kernel from @f$ x @f$ to @f$ x+\vec{\delta} @f$ " width=5cm

As seen on this illustration, only the green and the red part are
interesting, the grey part is the same from the previous result. This effect can produce a lot of computations, so we only
need to remove the green part, and add the red one (by additivity of the convolution).

@f[
  \widehat{Area}(B_{r/h}(\frac{1}{h} \cdot x + \vec{\delta} ) \cap Z, h) = \widehat{Area}(B_{r/h}(\frac{1}{h} \cdot x ) \cap Z, h)
  - \widehat{Area}(B1_{r/h}(\frac{1}{h} \cdot x ) \cap Z, h)
  + \widehat{Area}(B2_{r/h}(\frac{1}{h} \cdot x + \vec{\delta} ) \cap Z, h).
  \label{eq:eqmasks}
@f]

where @f$ \vec{\delta} @f$ is a translation vector in 0-adjacency, @f$ B1_{r/h} @f$ is the mask to remove, and @f$ B2_{r/h} @f$ the mask to
add (both depending to @f$ \vec{\delta} @f$).

We pre-compute at initialization of estimators a set a displacement masks from the full convolution kernel as shown above.
At evaluation, we use the full kernel for the first computation. If the next surfel is adjacent to the previous one, we use
a pair of masks (depending to the shift) to remove/add interested quantities to the last. In the worst case, all surfels
set by user to the estimator are not adjacent and it will compute the curvature always with the full convolution kernel,
which means no optimizations. The computation cost per surface element can be reduced from @f$ O((r/h)^{d}) @f$ (size of the
complete kernel) to @f$ O((r/h)^{d-1}) @f$, and the extra-cost of pre-computing displacement masks is meaningless: for example,
with a full 2d kernel support size of 91893, the optimization built 8 supplementary masks of size @f$ \approx @f$ 450.

\section sectImplementation Implementation in DGtal

It is important to consider connece range to evaluate with the Integral Invariant Curvature estimators in order to benefite the kernel optimization.
Note that the methodology is the same with both IntegralInvariantMeanCurvatureEstimator and IntegralInvariantGaussianCurvatureEstimator.
The only change is for "typedef IntegralInvariantXXXXXCurvatureEstimator<...> MyCurvatureEstimator"
