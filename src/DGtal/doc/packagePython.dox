@page packagePython DGtal python binding
   

@managers Pablo Hernandez-Cerdan, David Coeurjolly
@since 1.2


@b Package @b Overview

Since release 1.2, DGtal has a partial python binding using
[pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). To install the python
package, just use:
@code
pip install dgtal
@endcode

Then, you can import the module in python:

@code
import dgtal
....
@encode

At this point, only a partial support is available (some base, kernel,
image, topology classes). For a complete review of the available
tools, have a look to this
[Pull-Request](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/1528).
