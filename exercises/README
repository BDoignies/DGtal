This folder groups exercise files to practise DGtal. Each exercise is
contained in a specific folder whose name is prefixed by a number
indicating the its difficulty.


To compile the exercises: 
  
  - Create a specific build folder (e.g. on linux
    DGtalPATH/exercise/build)
  - In this build folder, generate your project file with cmake
    (e.g. on linux "cd build && cmake .."

For anwsers, contact the DGtal Team.
